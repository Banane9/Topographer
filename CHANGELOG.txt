0.1 - 4/15/2012
    * First release.
    * Only supports worlds saved in the Anvil format introduced in Minecraft
      1.2.
    * Block ids and colors are read from Blocks.txt. The format for each line:
        - blockId[:dataValue][,additionalIds];6-8 digit hex color code
          [aa]rrggbb #optional comment
        - If alpha isn't specified the color is assumed to be fully opaque.
    * The height rendered down from can be adjusted. Useful when a lower slice
      of the nether is needed, for example.
