0.4.1 - 4/25/2012
	* All memory for final image allocated at the start. Halves the amount of
	  memory previously needed at the end to combine the image parts into the
	  final output. If the program is going to run out of memory it should
	  happen nearly immediately. Not a permanent solution, but should allow
	  larger worlds approaching 1000 regions to be rendered and saved properly.

0.4 - 4/23/2012
    * New options:
        - Crop output image.
        - Rotate output image.
        - Only render certain block ids.
        - Exclude certain block ids from being rendered.
    * Some command line options were renamed/reorganized to support new
      options. Anything passing arguments to TopographerCMD my break until
      refactored.

0.3 - 4/20/2012
    * Added command line interface. It should work the same as the gui.
        - Use "TopographerCMD --help" for usage information.

0.2 - 4/16/2012
    * Block colors can now vary by biome. New format for Blocks.txt:
        - blockId[:dataValue][,additionalIds];[optional comma-separated biome
          ids;]6-8 digit hex color code [aa]rrggbb #optional comment
    * Now handles transparency correctly. For exapmle, water gets darker the
      deeper it is.
    * Made some features optional.
        - Whether biomes are considered when looking up block color, or if the
          default, biome-independent color for that block should be used.
        - Whether height should be indicated by making areas ligher or darker.
        - Whether transparent blocks should simply be displayed opaque.
    * Added ability to render a color-coded biome map instead of the normal
      terrain map.
        - Colors are read from Biomes.txt. The format for each line:
          comma-separated biome ids;6 digit hex color code rrggbb #optional
          comment
    * Added a few keyboard shortcuts.
        - Ctrl + O to open a world.
        - ESC to exit the program.
    * Added support for upcoming changes to world directory structure.
    * Fixed End region directory not being found.

0.1 - 4/15/2012
    * First release.
    * Only supports worlds saved in the Anvil format introduced in Minecraft
      1.2.
    * Block ids and colors are read from Blocks.txt. The format for each line:
        - blockId[:dataValue][,additionalIds];6-8 digit hex color code
          [aa]rrggbb #optional comment
        - If alpha isn't specified the color is assumed to be fully opaque.
    * The height rendered down from can be adjusted. Useful when a lower slice
      of the nether is needed, for example.
